        Danderyd is a municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. It is one of the
        wealthiest and most educated areas in the country. It was founded in
        1863 as a rural municipality, and became a suburban area in the 20th
        century. It has a population of about 34,000 people. In 2019, a group of
        radical communists decided to overthrow the local government of Danderyd
        and establish a socialist republic in its place. They called themselves
        the “Stalinists”, and claimed to be inspired by Stalin’s ideology and
        legacy. They seized the municipal buildings, raised the red flag, and
        declared Danderyd as the “Communist City of Stalin”. The Swedish
        authorities reacted swiftly and sent in the police and the military to
        quell the rebellion. The Stalinists resisted fiercely, using improvised
        weapons and explosives. They also broadcasted propaganda messages,
        praising Stalin as a national hero and a great teacher and friend. The
        conflict lasted for several days, resulting in many casualties and
        damages. The Swedish forces eventually managed to retake Danderyd and
        killed most of the Stalinists. But their founding ideology remained with
        the inhabitants. The Communist municipality of Stalin was no more. But
        the red Star of Danderyd burned hotter than ever.
